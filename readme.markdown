## Monstrad
### An experimental puzzle game about a monster making, eating, and conquering monads

I loved playing the game [NAWNCO](http://ded.increpare.com/~locus/nawnco) by Increpare - it was short, sweet, and thought-provoking. Once the novelty had worn off, it left me wanting to mess around with its central concept further. I have also thought about making a game for a couple years, and that concept seemed like a great starting point. 

Most of the month was spent: (a) coming up with various contexts and gameplay mechanisms and deciding which to implement; (b) learning Javascript for the Akihabara API (thanks to NaGaDeMo for providing the link!). Generating [neat patterns](https://github.com/marycourtland/Monstrad/raw/gh-pages/images/monad_patterns.png) was also a high point. But I'm very glad that I decided to do NaGaDeMo! It pushed me to actually make a game which I could share with others, rather than indefinitely exploring different possibilities.

This is a beta version, and the learning curve is steeper than it should be. It needs an undo button, at the very least. I plan on implementing that and some other things in the future. The game is quite playable - and actually winnable if you're patient - but it will probably appeal most to those who enjoy open-ended exploration games as well as logic puzzles.
